Dr. Alexandrov comes to UNL after three years as a research associate at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where he worked on modeling of coupled electron/ion transport dynamics through polycrystalline oxide networks, adsorption phenomena, interfacial electron transfer and selective oxidation of Ni-base alloys.

Alexandrov earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees from St. Petersburg State University in Russia, his Ph.D. from Max Planck Institute for Solid State Research/University of Stuttgart in Germany and then did postdoctoral work at the University of California, Davis and the University of California, Berkeley.
